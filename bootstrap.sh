<title>Sample site deployed with Terraform</title>
<body>

<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>
<p>

This site was deployed with Terraform to an EC2 instance in an Auto Scaling Group fronted by an Application Load balancer.
It's a basic page deployed by the userdata script, You could put an instruction to get the site from S3 for a full site.
